# closet-bot
A simple overcomplicated program that allows you to enter different items from your wardrobe. You enter the name, if it's seasonal, casual/business, and color. You can then track your wardrobe from an easily readable text tree-structure. You also can get randomized outfits. They can be completely random, or have set criteria to be met based on the values you assigned them.

Next update is to save outfits you like to access them later.
