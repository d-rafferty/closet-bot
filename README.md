# closet-bot
A simple overcomplicated program that allows you to enter different items from your wardrobe. You enter the name, if it's seasonal, casual/business, and color. You can then track your wardrobe from an easily readable text tree-structure. You also can get randomized outfits. They can be completely random, or have set criteria to be met based on the values you assigned them.

I am currently updating this program to get outfits matching color schemes, adding a GUI, as well as allowing you to save outfits you like to access them later.
